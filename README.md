# TWK.Prompter
![Alt text](/screenshot.jpg?raw=true "Screenshot")

Simple Windows based teleprompter software. Commercial options are either horribly expensive, or don't do basic things like let you set your own hotkeys for various actions.
Android options are very hit and miss.

* Partial support for *.docx and *.rtf (nothing too fancy formatting-wise!).
* Manual play for use with keyboard/foot pedal
